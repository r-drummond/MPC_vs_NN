Code for "Mapping back and forth between model predictive control and neural networks"  presented at the Learning for Dynamics and Control Conference, 2024.
Authors: Ross Drummond, Pablo Baldivieso, and Giorgio Valmorbida.

The code generates an implicit neural network (NN) characterisation of a model predictive control (MPC) policy. This implicit NN is unravelled using the method discussed in the paper. The idea is to write the solution of the MPC's quadratic programme exactly as an implicit neural network. A quick simulation is shown on an example system.
